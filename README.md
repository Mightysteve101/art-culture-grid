# art-culture-grid

I was given a task to update a page for the ENMU website. The school has recently started to promote this arts-culture page and wanted the page to be updated to look like the Runnels Gallery page on the website. Instead of starting from scratch I reused the html , CSS, and bootstrap from the Runnels Gallery. We use a content management system called Joomla. I was only able to extract the html from Joomla. So I had to go the Runnels page and get the CSS from inspect mode. From a previous project I worked on I already had the links and scripts to bootstrap. The transition didn’t work smoothly. For some reason the rows and columns were not acting the same. Instead of a 3-column grid it would only stack on top of each other with the photos being the wrong size. I tweaked the grid layout where the grid does a max of 3 columns then wraps to the next row like it should. The issue was there was a new row being placed after each column. Don’t know how this worked on the previous page but I fixed it on this one. Next the top three columns would stretch twice and large as the rest of the grid. The rest of the columns worked so I just copy an pasted those into the top three columns and it fixed the issue. I was able to transfer the look onto this page.
